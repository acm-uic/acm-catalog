                    <p>This website provides a full catalog of rentable items, server capabilities, and live metrics on system usage. Members can rent one item at a time, track due or overdue materials, view rental history, and manage workstation reservationsâ€”all with email notifications. Admins can add inventory, approve checkouts, manage members, track damaged items, and handle work orders via a built-in ticketing system and admin portal. The site also includes a contact form for work requests, a rental activity log, and visibility into workstation reservations, supporting clear, efficient resource management.</p>
